Compilation of analytics project
This repository is containing portfolio of data science and data analyst projects completed by me (and sometimes with my team) for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

# [Project 1: The analysis of Covid -19](https://github.com/thkduy2001/KhanhDuy-s_Portfolio/tree/main/Project1_TheAnalysisOfCovid19)
In this project I practiced the basic work of a data analyst such as data preprocessing: data collection, data cleaning, data extraction and Exploratory Data Analysis to learn the Covid - 19 problem through 2 datasets on Kaggle.com
