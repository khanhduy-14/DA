Compilation of analytics project
This repository is containing portfolio of data science and data analyst projects completed by me (and sometimes with my team) for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

# [Project 1: The analysis of Covid -19](https://thkduy2001.github.io/KhanhDuy-s_Portfolio/http://project1_theanalysisofcovid19)
This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.
Data was taken from the movielens dataset
The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques.
Algorithms Used : K-Nearest Neightbours, TF-IDFS, Singular Value Decomposition Model (SVD), Alternatining least Square (ALS)
Optimised the SVD & ALS model.
The Project Write-up is published on SSRN
