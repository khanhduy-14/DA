# KhanhDuy-s_Portfolio
Compilation of analytics project
This repository is containing portfolio of data science and data analyst projects completed by me (and sometimes with my team) for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.


# [Project 1: The analysis of Covid -19](https://github.com/thkduy2001/KhanhDuy-s_Portfolio/tree/main/Project1_TheAnalysisOfCovid19)
### [Click here to view project](https://github.com/thkduy2001/KhanhDuy-s_Portfolio/tree/main/Project1_TheAnalysisOfCovid19)
In this project I practiced the basic work of a data analyst such as data preprocessing: data collection, data cleaning, data extraction and Exploratory Data Analysis to learn the Covid - 19 problem through 2 datasets on Kaggle.com
Here is the link of datasets:
- Link 1: [Covid 19 Global](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephassaker/covid19-global-dataset)
- Link 2: [Covid 19 Vaccination Progess](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress)

# [Project 2: Car Price Prediction With MLR](https://github.com/thkduy2001/KhanhDuy-s_Portfolio/tree/main/Project2_CarPricePrediction(MLR))
### [Click here to view project](https://github.com/thkduy2001/KhanhDuy-s_Portfolio/tree/main/Project2_CarPricePrediction(MLR))
This project implemented using MLR to build an external vehicle price prediction model and used some data analyst skills such as data collection, data cleaning, data correlation, evaluation. model (basic).
